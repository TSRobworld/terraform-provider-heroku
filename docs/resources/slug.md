# heroku\_slug

Provides a [Heroku Slug](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#slug)
resource.

This resource supports uploading a pre-generated archive file of executable code, making it possible to launch apps
directly from a Terraform config. This resource does not itself generate the slug archive.
[A guide to creating slug archives](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-deploying-slugs) is available
in the Heroku Dev Center.

## Minimal Example

Create a ready-to-release slug:

* `file_url` or `file_path` must reference a file containing a slug archive of executable code
  and must follow the prescribed layout from [Create slug archive](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-deploying-slugs#create-slug-archive)
  in the Heroku Dev Center (nested within an `./app` directory)
* The archive may be created by an external build system, downloaded from another Heroku app,
  or otherwise provided outside of the context of this Terraform resource
* If the content (SHA256) of `file_path` changes, then a new resource will be forced on the next plan/apply;
  if the file does not exist, the difference is ignored.
* The `file_url` is only fetched during resource creation. To trigger another fetch the `file_url` should be changed,
  then a new resource will be forced on the next plan/apply.

```hcl-terraform
resource "heroku_app" "foobar" {
  name = "foobar"
  region = "us"
}

resource "heroku_slug" "foobar" {
  app_id   = heroku_app.foobar.id
  file_url = "https://github.com/heroku/terraform-provider-heroku/raw/master/heroku/test-fixtures/slug.tgz"

  process_types = {
    web = "ruby server.rb"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage

Complete config to launch a Heroku app:

```hcl-terraform
resource "heroku_app" "foobar" {
    name = "foobar"
    region = "us"
}

# Create a slug for the app with a local slug archive file
resource "heroku_slug" "foobar" {
  app_id                         = heroku_app.foobar.id
  buildpack_provided_description = "Ruby"
  // The slug archive file must already exist
  file_path                      = "slug.tgz"

  process_types = {
    web = "ruby server.rb"
  }
}

# Deploy a release to the app with the slug
resource "heroku_app_release" "foobar" {
  app_id  = heroku_app.foobar.id
  slug_id = heroku_slug.foobar.id
}

# Launch the app's web process by scaling-up
resource "heroku_formation" "foobar" {
  app_id     = heroku_app.foobar.id
  type       = "web"
  quantity   = 1
  size       = "Standard-1x"
  depends_on = ["heroku_app_release.foobar"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `app_id` - (Required) Heroku app ID (do not use app name)
* `buildpack_provided_description` - Description of language or app framework, `"Ruby/Rack"`;
  displayed as the app's language in the Heroku Dashboard
* `checksum` - Hash of the slug for verifying its integrity, auto-generated from contents of `file_path` or `file_url`,
  `SHA256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`
* `commit` - Identification of the code with your version control system (eg: SHA of the git HEAD), `"60883d9e8947a57e04dc9124f25df004866a2051"`
* `commit_description` - Description of the provided commit
* `file_path` - (Required unless `file_url` is set) Local path to a slug archive, `"slugs/current.tgz"`
* `file_url` - (Required unless `file_path` is set) **https** URL to a slug archive, `"https://example.com/slugs/app-v1.tgz"`
* `process_types` - (Required) Map of [processes to launch on Heroku Dynos](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/process-model)
* `stack` - Name or ID of the [Heroku stack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stack)

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the slug
* `app` - The ID or unique name of the Heroku app
* `blob` - Slug archive (compressed tar of executable code)
  * `method` - HTTP method to upload the archive
  * `url` - Pre-signed, expiring URL to upload the archive
* `buildpack_provided_description` - Description of language or app framework, `"Ruby/Rack"`
* `checksum` - Hash of the slug for verifying its integrity, auto-generated from contents of `file_path` or `file_url`
* `commit` - Identification of the code with your version control system (eg: SHA of the git HEAD), `"60883d9e8947a57e04dc9124f25df004866a2051"`
* `commit_description` - Description of the provided commit
* `process_types` - Map of [processes to launch on Heroku Dynos](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/process-model)
* `size` - Slug archive filesize in bytes
* `stack` - [Heroku stack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stack) name
* `stack_id` - [Heroku stack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stack) ID

## Import
Existing slugs can be imported using the combination of the application name, a colon, and the slug ID.

For example:

```
$ terraform import heroku_slug.foobar bazbux:4f1db8ef-ed5c-4c42-a3d6-3c28262d5abc
```

* `foobar` is the **heroku_slug** resource's name
* `bazbux` is the Heroku app name (or ID) that the slug belongs to
* `:` separates the app identifier & the slug identifier
* `4f1db8efâ€¦` is the slug ID
